# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution  

This is my solution to the [QR Code Component Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). This challenge helped me refine my HTML and SCSS skills while focusing on layout accuracy and semantic HTML5 usage.

## My Process  

### Built With  
- Semantic HTML5  
- SCSS  
- CSS Flexbox  
- Mobile-first approach  

### What I Learned  

This project was a great exercise in layout precision. I focused on getting the design as close as possible to the original. Key takeaways include:  

- **Proper Background Setup:** I learned how to properly set a background and center an item with its own background.  
- **Flexbox Mastery:** I used Flexbox to align and position elements efficiently.  
- **Mobile-First Mindset:** While media queries weren’t necessary, I still approached the project with a mobile-first workflow.  
- **Semantic HTML Considerations:** Initially, I relied heavily on `<div>` elements, but after researching semantic HTML5, I refactored my code to use more meaningful elements.  

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of **semantic HTML** and its benefits for accessibility and code readability. Instead of using generic `<div>` elements everywhere, I incorporated:  

- `<main>` for the primary content  
- `<section>` to group related sections  
- `<figure>` to wrap the QR code image  
- `<h1>` for the main heading  

Using **semantic HTML** makes the code **more structured, accessible, and easier to maintain**, while also improving SEO and screen reader compatibility. Moving forward, I’ll continue prioritizing semantic elements over generic `<div>`s whenever possible.  
 
### Continued Development  

This project was a small challenge, but I’ll use it as a reference for future projects, especially for **better structure and accessibility practices**.
